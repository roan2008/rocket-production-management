Notes

This PHP application includes several HTML pages with inline styles but no responsive layout or shared CSS. For example, public/index.php embeds a <style> block defining table borders and paddings, with no viewport meta tag:

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Production Orders</title>
    <style>
        table { border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; }
        th, td { border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 8px; }
    </style>
</head>

Likewise, the login page defines its own minimal styles:

<title>Login</title>
<style>
    body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 2em; }
    .error { color: red; }
</style>

Forms such as create_order.php also include inline styling rather than reusable components:

<title>Create Order</title>
<style>
    body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em; }
    .error { color: red; }
    table { border-collapse: collapse; }
    th, td { border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 4px; }
</style>

These pages would benefit from a consistent design framework and responsive behavior.

Suggested plan for UI/UX improvements
Select a framework

Choose between Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap. Bootstrap offers built-in components (forms, tables, buttons) that can quickly replace the inline styles. Tailwind provides more flexibility but requires utility classes everywhere.

Include the framework via CDN (e.g. <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr...">) since there is no build pipeline.

Create a shared layout/header

Extract the repeated <head> section and basic structure into public/includes/header.php (or similar).

Include the chosen CSS framework, <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">, and a shared navigation bar.

Update each PHP page to include this header and a matching footer for consistency.

Responsive layout

Wrap page content inside Bootstrap’s .container (or Tailwind’s max-w classes).

Use responsive grid classes for forms and tables so they adapt on mobile.

Replace inline table styles with framework classes like .table, .table-striped, etc.

Improve form design

Convert each <label>/input> pair to use framework form groups (<div class="mb-3">, <input class="form-control">).

For dynamic tables (liner usage, process logs), apply classes for spacing and readability.

Provide clear submit and cancel buttons with consistent .btn styles.

Add loading states

For asynchronous actions such as fetching models in create_order.php (lines 87–94), show a small spinner while the request is running.

On form submission (create/edit order, login), disable the submit button and show a loading indicator until the request completes.

Use Bootstrap’s spinner component or Tailwind equivalents.

Optional cleanup

Move existing custom CSS (table borders, fonts) into a separate public/css/app.css file to override or complement the framework styles.

Ensure forms and tables provide adequate spacing on smaller screens.

By following these steps, the application will gain a consistent look-and-feel, work well on mobile devices, and give users visual feedback during operations such as logging in or saving orders.
