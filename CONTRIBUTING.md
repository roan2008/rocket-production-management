## üíª Coding Standards

### PHP Standards
```php
<?php
/**
 * Class description
 * 
 * @author Your Name
 * @version 1.0.0
 */
class ProductionOrder {
    // Properties (private first)
    private $productionNumber;
    
    // Constructor
    public function __construct($database) {
        $this->database = $database;
    }
    
    // Public methods
    public function createOrder($data) {
        // Method implementation
    }
    
    // Private methods
    private function validateData($data) {
        // Helper method implementation
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Standards
```javascript
// Use ES6+ features
const ProductionOrderManager = {
    // Method naming: camelCase
    initializeForm() {
        // Implementation
    },
    
    // Async operations
    async saveOrder(orderData) {
        try {
            const response = await this.makeRequest('/api/orders.php', orderData);
            return response;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Save order failed:', error);
            throw error;
        }
    }
};
```

### CSS Standards
```css
/* BEM Methodology */
.production-order { /* Block */ }
